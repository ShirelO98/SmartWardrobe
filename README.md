# SmartWardrobe Project

## Description

The SmartWardrobe project is a web application designed to manage and organize wardrobe items. It allows users to view and update their wardrobe items, manage looks, and interact with various features related to wardrobe management. The application includes functionalities for adding, editing, and deleting items, as well as filtering and sorting them based on different criteria. 

Additionally, the application provides a feature for consulting with a stylist. Users can consult with a stylist who has the ability to view their wardrobes and select looks for specific events based on the user's requests. This personalized service enhances the wardrobe management experience by offering expert advice and tailored look recommendations.

## External APIs

### Weather API

The project integrates with an external Weather API to provide weather information based on the city input by the user. This feature allows users to receive real-time weather updates and helps in planning wardrobe choices based on weather conditions.

## External Libraries

### SweetAlert2

For a more interactive and modern user experience, the project utilizes the SweetAlert2 library. This library is used for displaying stylish and customizable alert messages throughout the application, replacing traditional browser alerts with more user-friendly and visually appealing dialogs.
